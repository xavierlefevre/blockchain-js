# Simple TypeScript Blockchain

## Introduction

This project is for personal educational purposes. My objective is to build a mental mapping of a blockchain's design.
I leverage different online resources to progressively build-up a more complete blockchain.

## Start

-   Install dependencies: `yarn`
-   Launch the transactions simulation: `npx ts-node index.ts`

## Todo

-   Draft and document the current implementation with a diagram
-   Setup a Peer-to-peer process
